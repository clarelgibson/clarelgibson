Hi! I'm Clare Gibson and I'm a data analysis and visualisation expert. I currently work for [GSK](https://gsk.com) where I develop data-driven diversity goals for clinical research participation using demographic and epidemiology datasets.

When I'm not working I love to explore data relating to my interests, from [UK school admissions](https://public.tableau.com/views/EnglandSchoolAdmissions-2022Editionv1_0_1/Home?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) to [used Tesla Model 3 vehicles](https://public.tableau.com/views/TeslaM3InventoryUK/Inventory?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). Through my passion projects I have developed skills in R, Tableau, PowerBI, Google Cloud Platform, Github Actions.

The picture above is my desk at home. The little birds in the photo were made by my very talented father. They keep me company and sometimes act as my [rubber ducks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).
